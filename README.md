# open_rvl
 This repo contains a WIP decompilation of the Revolution (RVL) SDK.  

 This project targets the version in Wii Sports (`__MWCC__ == 0x4199_60831`), but it should be adaptable to other projects with minimal effort.  

 The Revolution SDK makes up a considerable portion of most game binaries (avg. > 20%), so this project is designed to save other projects' time by containing common code for anyone to use.  

 File, function, symbol, variable, and other names come from various games' debugging information (symbol map, DWARF, etc.). Leaked material must not be referenced as it will jeopardize the legality of any project that uses open_rvl.
